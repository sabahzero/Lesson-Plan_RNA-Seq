# Practice Lesson for RNA-Seq Data Analysis [Mar 26, 2019]

## Overview and aims of today
Time Point 1 (5 min) - Identify the data, how was it produced? </br>
Time Point 2 (10 min) - Walk through the data through visualization and analysis </br>
Time Point 3 (5 min) - Interpretations of results </br>
Time Point 4 (10 min) - Additional ways of analysis, and general Q&A </br>

### Time Point 1 (5 min): Introduction, understanding RNA-Seq
Question A: What is RNA-Seq, and why use it? </br> </br>

RNA-Seq is a next generation sequencing (NGS) method used to inform us of changes in the transcriptome. A transcriptome being the mRNA of a given cell or organism. RNA-Seq is commonly used as a tool for identifying changes before or after treatment *in vitro* (in a test tube) or *in vivo* (directly in the organism or environment of interest). </br>

Question B: What is the nature of the RNA-Seq data we are using today?

### Time Point 2 (10 min): Basics, creating a bar chart and changing color schemes

### Time Point 3 (5 min): Interpreting the analysis of results, visualization vs statistics

### Time Point 4 (10 min): Discussion, Q&A
